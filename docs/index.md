# Welcome to cg-django-uaa\'s documentation

This is a [cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/) UAA authentication backend for
Django. Features include:

- A handy `fake cloud.gov <fakeauth>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    that makes it easy to log in as any user during development.
- Transparent refreshing of short-lived access tokens, ensuring that
    users are automatically logged out of the system soon after
    cloud.gov says they are unauthorized.

To get started, see the [`quickstart`](./quickstart.md)
